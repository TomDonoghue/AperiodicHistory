# Aperiodic History

`AperiodicHistory` project repository: an overview on historical work on aperiodic neural activity.

## Overview

The study of aperiodic neural activity has recently a relatively become feature of interest in analyses of neuro-electrophysiological recordings. In doing so, it is become to note that aperiodic activity has historically been ignored and under-examined. While this is broadly the case, there has also consistently been explicit examination of aperiodic activity dating back to the early days of EEG, even if this work was often under-appreciated. This project provides an overview of historical work on the study of aperiodic neural activity.

## Project Guide

This project is a perspective / review of the historical literature. This project repository does some literature collections and analyses as part of the project. You can step through all literature collection and analyses by stepping through the `notebooks`.

## Reference

A preprint for this project is upcoming.
