## Overview

The study of aperiodic neural activity has recently a relatively become feature of interest in analyses of neuro-electrophysiological recordings. In doing so, it is become to note that aperiodic activity has historically been ignored and under-examined. While this is broadly the case, there has also consistently been explicit examination of aperiodic activity dating back to the early days of EEG, even if this work was often under-appreciated. This project provides an overview of historical work on the study of aperiodic neural activity.

## Project Guide

This project is a perspective / review of the historical literature. This project repository does some literature collections and analyses as part of the project.

This project includes an annotated bibliography, which is available in the `annotated_bibliography` folder.

You can step through all literature collection and analyses in the Literature related Jupyter notebooks. An additional notebook creates the example figures used in the manuscript. The `local` folder contains some local code for this project.
